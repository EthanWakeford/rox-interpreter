# Rox Interpreter

Interpreter built based on Lox from the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) (Rox = Rust Lox).

Rox is a dynamically typed scripting language, similar to python, js. It has support for all language basics like control flow, loops, lexical scoping, first class functions, and closures.

Currently this is just the front-end of the language before diving into the second half of the book where I build out a virtual machine to run the program on. The runtime of the language is currently also implemented in Rust.

Sometime later I should add code examples on how to use Rox. Currently script.rox is a pretty good example of what Rox can do.
